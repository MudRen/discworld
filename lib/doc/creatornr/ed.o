Following is the list of commands that can be obtained from inside ed by typing 'h'.  The file you specify will be expanded and if it matches to more than one file, the first file you specify will be used.  If the file cannot be written by you, it will also print [read only].  Any changes you make, will not be saved if that is the case.  Ed is very similar to ex and ed on unix machines so if you can find documentation for those commands, it will help you in ed.
