There is no need for wielding weapons as holding them does basicly this.  If you wield a weapon in your non prime hand (it defaults to putting things in your prime hand, thats a hint) it will do less damage than if it is in your prime hand.You can wield two weapons, one in each hand.  But again they will do less damage each than if you were wielding just one.  You can also use this command to hold shields in specific hands.  If you wear a shield it will use any free limbs you have.The hold hands and hold nothing versions of this command remove everything from your hands. ","See also",3,5,5,"unhold ",})
