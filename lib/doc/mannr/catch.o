If there is no error, 0 is returned. If there is a standard error, a string (with a leading '*') will be returned.The function throw() can also be used to immediately return any value, except 0. catch() is not really a function call, but a directive to the compiler.The catch() is somewhat costly, and should not be used just anywhere. Rather, use it at places where an error would destroy consistency.  ","See also",7,5,"throw(3)","",})
