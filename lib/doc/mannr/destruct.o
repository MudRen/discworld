The argument can also be a string.  After the call to destruct(), no global variables will exist any longer, only local, and arguments.If an object self-destructs, it will immediately terminate execution and return 0. There is one exception: if the destruct statement is followed by a 'return 1' immediately after, then this return statement will be executed.This should NOT be used on normal objects in the game, instead use the lfun 'remove' in the object you want removed (i.e. ob->remove();). This will ensure correct update of weights, volumes etc.  ","See also",7,5,"clone_object(3), remove(l)","",})
