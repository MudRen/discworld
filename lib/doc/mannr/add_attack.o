This does NOT mean that if you have three add_attacks they need be set at say 20,40,40 as they could all be at 100,100,100 and still work, it is their own percentage chance.","This is the inital damage in hit points and, using an array, you can do a funky AD&D dice thing. For example to do 100 hps + 5-10 sided dice it would be ({ 100 , 5 , 10 }). giving anything between 105 and 150 hps damage.","This is the percent chance of doing additional damage on a successful strike.
