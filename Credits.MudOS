Read the Credits.LPmud file for credit information on the original LPmud
driver (that upon which MudOS is based).  LPmud was originally written
by Lars Pensj|, April 1989.

The following information is not guaranteed to be complete.  (I
apologize in advance if I have forgotten anyone).  For more information
read the various 'done' and 'ChangeLog' files.

We would like to thank the following muds for extensive testing and numerous
bug reports:

TMI, Portals, Overdrive, Genocide, TMI-2, Vincent's Hollow, and DreamShadow.

The MudOS driver was a team effort with specific contributions from the
following people:

Jeremy Radlow (Whiplash) - original mappings implementation, virtual objects,
   master::crash callback, and others.

Erik Kay (Wayfarer) - runtime config system, message() efun, and others.

John Garnett (Truilkan) - improved mappings implementation, process_input
   and write_prompt callbacks, DEBUGMALLOC, C++ style comments, lazy resets,
   master::valid_override callback, improved shared string management, and
   others.

Stephen Iannce (Huthar) - children() and message() efuns, extensive testing of
  the socket efunctions.

Joel York (Shadowhawk) - multiple arguments version of input_to(), dprint
   option to ed.

Dwayne Fontenot (Jacques) - major rewrite of comm.c, TCP socket efuns.

Dave Richards (Cynosure) - UDP socket efuns, enhanced TCP socket efuns,
   ported MudOS to the Sequent Symmetry (System VR3)

Bob Farmer (Blackthorn) - fixed various efuns to honor the hidden object flags

James Waldrop (Sulam) - helped with reorganizing the huge switch in
   interpret.c into efunctions.c.

Special thanks to Adam Beeman (Buddha) for making numerous suggestions on
improving the MudOS driver and for providing the TMI site as the original
place for MudOS contributors to meet.
