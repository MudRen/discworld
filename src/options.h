 * WRAPPEDMALLOC: wrapper for builtin system malloc.  Provides limited
 *   statistics, can be used in conjunction with BSDMALLOC.  Limited
 *   additional cpu overhead and no additional memory overhead.
 * DEBUGMALLOC:  May be used in conjunction with BSD malloc.  Provides
 *   statistics on precisely how much memory has been malloc'd (as well
 *   as the stats provided by WRAPPEDMALLOC). Incurs a fair amount of
 *   overhead (in terms of memory and cpu usage).
 * GMALLOC: GNU malloc (not included: available from prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu).
 *   **has not been recently tested with MudOS.
 * GCMALLOC: garbage collecting malloc (not included).
 *   **has not been recently tested with MudOS.
 *
 * [NOTE: BSD malloc is also an option however it must be selected from the
 *  Makefile rather than here since it is an actual replacement for system
 *  malloc rather than a wrapper for system malloc as are SYSMALLOC and
